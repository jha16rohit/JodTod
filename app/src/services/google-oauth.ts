/**
 * Google OAuth configuration for JodTod — single source of truth.
 *
 * This exists because the previous implementation resolved the OAuth
 * client and redirect implicitly, and both resolutions were wrong:
 *
 *  1. NO `redirectUri` was passed to `Google.useIdTokenAuthRequest`, so
 *     expo-auth-session fell back to `makeRedirectUri()`. That helper is
 *     environment-dependent by design (SDK 57 docs):
 *
 *        makeRedirectUri({ scheme, path })
 *          Development Build -> my-scheme://redirect
 *          Expo Go           -> exp://127.0.0.1:8081/--/redirect
 *
 *     In Expo Go the packager's LAN address was therefore sent to Google
 *     as the redirect, producing `Error 400: invalid_request`
 *     ("Access blocked: Authorization Error").
 *
 *  2. `app.json` had no `googleAndroidClientId`, and the code fell back
 *     to the WEB client ID for Android. expo-auth-session picks the
 *     client by platform (`android -> androidClientId`), so a Web-type
 *     client was combined with a custom-scheme redirect — a combination
 *     Google rejects outright. A Web client only accepts http(s)
 *     redirect URIs; a custom scheme requires an Android client.
 *
 * Fixes enforced here:
 *  - The redirect URI is DETERMINISTIC and derived from the app's own
 *    configured scheme (`app.json -> expo.scheme`). It never depends on
 *    the packager host, a LAN IP, or the build flavour.
 *  - The client ID is resolved per platform and is NEVER substituted
 *    across client types.
 *  - The three build environments (Expo Go / development build /
 *    production) are distinguished explicitly. A custom-scheme redirect
 *    cannot be delivered by Expo Go, so that case is reported as a
 *    controlled, actionable state instead of hanging on "Connecting...".
 *
 * No client secret is present here or anywhere in the app: Google
 * client secrets are backend-only (`backend/.env`), and the mobile app
 * only ever receives a Google-issued ID token, which the backend
 * verifies server-side.
